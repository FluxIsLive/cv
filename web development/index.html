        My personality consists of different characteristic traits and habits which help me make a decent human being. Certain aspects of my personality are good while there are other negative sides as well. However, the following are the better aspects of my personality.<br>
        I make sure I have the basic good habits which include respecting my elders, greeting people when I meet them, wishing them well when departing etc. Other than this, observing the law, serving the poor and downtrodden, helping the sick and needy, giving shelter to the homeless, assisting someone with a handicap, etc. are also other good habits of mine. To lead on a peaceful life, I develop other good habits like reading, writing, listening to music, dancing, singing etc. Going to the temple and offering prayers, giving alms to the poor, supporting the old etc. are other such habits which fulfill the needs of my soul.<br>
        Knowledge is of utmost importance today. Knowledge gives me the ability to survive and tackle different kinds of situations. It also makes me more rational and pragmatic. Thus, I tend to understand things quicker than others and always weigh the pros and cons of a situation. Knowledge comes from learning. Learned people are known to be more efficient, more sincere and more honest than the others. The human faculties are developed by knowledge. The development of human faculties ensures fair play, equal treatment and sound judgment in various different situations.<br>
